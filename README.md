 A library that extends the C standard library.

## Build Istd

Istd currently only supports C11, older versions may work but they are not tested or officially supported for now. 
Istd is also mainly designed for x86_64 platforms. x86 may work but is not test or officially supported.

Istd currently requires two defines `NDEBUG` which is defined when in release mode and `DEBUG` which is defined when in debug mode.
